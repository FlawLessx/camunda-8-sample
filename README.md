# Using the Spring Boot application

The application requires a running Zeebe engine.
You can run Zeebe locally using the instructions below for Docker Compose
or have a look at our
[recommended deployment options for Camunda Platform](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/#deployment-recommendation.).

Run the application via
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Maybe skip the tests if you are on an older JDK than Version 17
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

## Using docker-compose

To stand-up a complete Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed environment locally the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file in this repository can be used.

The full enviornment contains these components:
- Zeebe
- Operate
- Tasklist
- Optimize
- Identity
- Elasticsearch
- KeyCloak

Clone this repo and issue the following command to start your environment:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait a few minutes for the environment to start up and settle down. Monitor the logs, especially the Keycloak container log, to ensure the components have started.

Now you can navigate to the different web apps and log in with the user `demo` and password `demo`:
- Operate: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- Tasklist: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
- Optimize: [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
- Identity: [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)
- Elasticsearch: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)
- KeyCloak: [http://localhost:18080](http://localhost:18080)

The workflow engine Zeebe is available using gRPC at `localhost:26500`.

To tear down the whole environment run the following command

```
docker-compose down -v
```
